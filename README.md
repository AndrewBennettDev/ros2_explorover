# ROS2 ExploRover

### Description
This repo is an experimental workspace for a small, autonomous rover I am building. The rover
utilizes a Raspberry Pi 4 as the primary computer, an Arduino Nano for motor control, and a
simple Logitech web cam for vision. More details will be added later.

### Usage
TODO: add notes on installing ROS2, setting up workspace, cloning repo, and running
